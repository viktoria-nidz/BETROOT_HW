            <p>
              Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
              looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
              underline <u> their own section</u>. Continue reading for an
              introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and
              more!

            <h2>Core Components</h2>
            <p>
              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
              capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable
              code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
              first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

            <h2>React Fundamentals</h2>
            <p class="pros">
              React Native runs on <u> React</u>, a popular open source library
              for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of
              React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
              can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>

            <p class="pros">
              We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
            </p>
            <ul class="pros">
              <li>
                <span>+ components</span> The rest of this introduction to React
                uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that
                need names and a cafe to work in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span> + JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax
                that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                <code>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code> .
                The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can
                refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
                variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
                name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
                <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> .
              </li>
              <li><span>+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</li>
              <li>
                <span>+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments
                you use to configure how components render, state is like a
                component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling
                data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
                State gives your components memory!
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Handling Text Input</h2>
            <p>
              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called
              every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
              takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
