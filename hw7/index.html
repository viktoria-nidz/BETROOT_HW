            Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
            looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
            underline <u> their own section</u>. Continue reading for an
            introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and
            more!

          <p class="sect_text">
            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
            capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable
            code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
            let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

          <p class="sect_text pros">
            React Native runs on <u> React</u>, a popular open source library
            for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of
            React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
            get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
          </p>

          <p class="sect_text pros">
            We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
          </p>
          <ul class="pros">
            <li>
              <span>+ components</span> The rest of this introduction to React
              uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that
              need names and a cafe to work in.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span> + JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that
              lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
              <code>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code> . The
              React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer
              to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
              variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
              name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
              <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> .
            </li>
            <li><span>+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</li>
            <li>
              <span>+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments
              you use to configure how components render, state is like a
              component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling
              data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
              State gives your components memory!
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="sect"><sup>4</sup> Handling Text Input</h2>
          <p class="sect_text">
            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
            has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every
            time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
            function to be called when the text is submitted.
          </p>

          <p class="sect_text">
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
            there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
